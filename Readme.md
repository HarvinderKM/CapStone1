# Capstone 1: Accounting Ledger 
# By: Harvinder Kaur

## Description: 
For this project my game plan was to 
create multiple classes/methods that each had their own function.
once you run the program, it gives you options to choose form which include: making a deposit, making a payment, ledger new screen, or exit.

## Images of Application Screen: 
When you first run the program:

## Interesting piece of code:
I enjoyed completing the following try-catch code because I was able to figure out why the exception wasn't printing, I learned to use InputMismatchException which returned my intended print out.
